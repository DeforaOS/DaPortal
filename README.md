DeforaOS DaPortal 2
===================

About DaPortal 2
----------------

DaPortal 2 is a Content Management System (CMS) written in the PHP programming
language. Although PHP is primarily designed as a language and environment for
web-based applications, it can also be used directly from the command line, or
while building rich applications on the desktop. DaPortal also supports some of
these additional possibilities.

Likewise, DaPortal 2 does not depend on any specific database backend. It will
often require a SQL server though, of which the following ones are already
supported:

 * SQLite 2 & 3
 * PostgreSQL
 * PDO (therefore MySQL, and possibly more)

The homepage of DaPortal 2 can be found at
